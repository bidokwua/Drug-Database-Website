# Potential User Interactions

Searching and filtering data by state, age, ethnicity, and drug type
Comparing overdose trends across demographics and regions
Highlighting the potential consequences of drug use in a way that feels close to home
Providing valuable insights to both new and current drug users, as well as informing bystanders and communities about the dangers and impacts of drug misuse
# 3 potential user interactions:
1. Use a number to look up age ranges for data
Potential Advantages: Allows users to pick which age groups they are interested in seeing data about
Potential Disadvantages: Users over 25 are grouped together so it will be harder to understand the specifics for people above that age
Potential Benefits: It will benefit users so they can compare substance use across age ranges
Potential Harms: Outdatedness of the data could lead to potential misconceptions about drug use for certain demographics
  
2. Look up a row based on a string (location or drug)
Potential Advantages: These variables allow users to have specicialized perspectives on drug use trends based on location or any other string
Potential Disadvantages: If users accidentally misspell states’ or drug’s name (because they could be complicated), the search will be invalid.
Potential benefits: Users could reach their targeted data directly. Specific location could make data more relatable for users who're searching up somewhere familiar. 
Potential harms: Users would easily recieve information that's not updated and may not understand or know the names of drugs in the dataset so it would be harder for them to look these up

3. Look up the row based on the year as a number
Potential Advantages: Users can pick years that they find particularly interesting
Potential Disadvantages: Because the data is of a specific time period and doesn't update, the data doesn't reflect the change as time goes on
Potential Benefit: Help users who are looking for data to use in either a report or a data-driven argument
Potential Harm: Not all years are a part of the dataset so it is possible that data analysis using our dataset might not be very accurate or helpful
